# Server-Implementation-Project
This is a basic implementation of a TCP server in C++. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port, accepts incoming connections, and sends a welcome message to the client. This implementation can serve as a starting point for more complex server implementations.

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler, such as g++ or clang++
The following C++ libraries:
iostream
string
cstring
sys/socket.h
netinet/in.h
unistd.h

This project was inspired by various online resources and tutorials on TCP server implementations in C++. Thank you to the creators of those resources for their contributions to the community.
